I am a third year graduate student in [Chelsea Specht's lab](http://blogs.cornell.edu/specht/) in Plant biology at Cornell. I am an evolutionary biologist interested in the processes that give rise to diverse patterns of morphology. My dissertation is focused on the evolution of inflorescences â€“ branches of flowers, in the Amaryllis family *(Amaryllidaceae)* with a specific emphasize on the Onion/Garlic genus *(Allium)*. To learn more about this Umbel-ivable phenotypes (or if you don't understand the pun), check out my [research page](https://jesusthebotanist.github.io/projects/Umbels.html).
