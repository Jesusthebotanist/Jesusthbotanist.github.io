The summer before my freshmen year of college I had the amazing oppertunity to participate in the University of Washington GenOM ALVA program: A nine week in-resident undergraduate research experiance. We took college level STEM prepaptory course in the morning such as chemistry, calculus, molecular lab training and in the afternoon worked in our research laboratory. The administrators (especially the director Lisa Peterson) and the frineds I mad layed the supportive foundation for my success in college. 

But arguable the most influencual aspect of this program was my placement in Veronica Di Stilio lab. I learned to be a molecular scientist and continued working in her for the rest of my time at the University of Washington. 

There I met some of my best friends through college and layed the foundation for my research experinace. 

The results of project that year are curretly being written up for publication and will hopefully be out soon. In the mean 


The program is still active and has expanded to include rising seniors in higher as well as engineering students. Check them out [here](http://depts.washington.edu/genomics/index.shtml?58,33). 


I managed to dig up the paper I wrote and scientific poster I made. While I'd like to think the rigour of my science has increase, one unfortent thing that hasn't change is my ability to spell and grammer check. I don't know how other do it but it is just so hard!
