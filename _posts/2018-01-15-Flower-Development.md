TLDR; The APETALA3 lineage genes, classically known to function in petal and stamen development in many angiosperms, specify stamen development and underlie the petaloid features of the perianth in Medow Rue (*Thalictrum thalictroides*). Recent duplicates have resulted in partial redundancy in these genetic programmes as well as promiscuity in protein-protein interaction. Check out the work [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.00334/abstract) 

Nothing can brighten a day quite like a colorful flower. Their vibrant colors offer a treat to pollinators in exchange for the dispersal of pollen and seeds. In many case the floral organs responsible for their delightful color are the petals. The form of the petals, their shape, their color, provide us with a hint to whom they attract. Red tubular flowers are known to attract hummingbirds, that see in infared and reach the bottom of the long flower weith their beak.  Blue round flowers attract insects, who can see in the ultra violete spectrum and who land on the landing pad. While petals take center stage, they are not the only floral organ that can be colorful. In some cases the stamen, the male reproductive parts that make pollen, can be colorful (check out the work of Chelsea Specht for more on this!). In other cases the sepals, the green leaf-like structure that enclose the flower when its in a bud, can also express attraction. During my undergraduate I had the fantastic oppertunity to research what makes flowers colorful in the lab of [Veronica Di Stilio](http://faculty.washington.edu/distilio/) at the University of Washington.

We worked with a cute little group of flowers called Medow-Rue. The entire genus is apetalus, they lacks petals, however in some members of the clade the sepal express a few petal feature: They are large, scented, their cells are puzzle shaped and they are colorful. We wanted to understand what were the molecular mechanism, what were the genes, that made the sepals white. Luckily we weren't starting from zero, a great deal of work had already elucidated the genes underlying petal development in thale cress (*Arabidopsis thaliana*). They showed that a group of genes called the 'B-class' genes, specified petal and stamen development. Additionally, these same genes seemed to be responsible for petal development in an additional array of flowering plants. Perhaps these genes were involved in producing similar features in the sepals of *Thalictrum*.

Along with my menotor [Kelsey Galimba](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/kearneysville-wv/appalachian-fruit-research-laboratory/innovative-fruit-production-improvement-and-protection/people/kelsey-galimba/) we characterized the developmental function of the B-class genes in the genus *Thalictrum*. The 'B-class' genes in *Thalictrum* are comprised of three different genes AP3-1, AP3-2a, AP3-2b. The similarity in their names reflects their evolutionary relationship as these genes are the result of two gene duplication events.
