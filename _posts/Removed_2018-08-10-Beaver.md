I finally made the move to upstate New York! It was an eventful ride but I was glad to finally chill out in the slow rolling hills of the Northeast. But New York had a different plan! I got caught in a crazy thunderstrorm my second day here, I thought I had gotten a tick bite but it turned out to be ants after my banana. 

But the craziest thing was the Beaver. I saw a Beaver! Except, it wasn't a beaver. It was a ground hog... allegedly. Below is a video of my amazing encounter with nature, pardon my language, I was a bit frigthten. Make sure to read the Twitter comments on the see what twitter scientist think this mysterius member of Mamalia was!
