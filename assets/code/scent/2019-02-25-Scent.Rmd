## Test for Phylogenetic Signal
We were intrested in testing whether closely related species exhibitd similar amounts of volitale compounds. We can do this by calculating Blombergs K a measure of phylogenetic signal. Generally you can interpret K as the following

K < 1 closely related species are less similar than expected under brownian motion. 
K = 1 closely related species are as similar/different as expected under brownian motion
K > 1  closely related species are more similar than expected under brownian motion.  

This is traditionally performed on single trait, however biologist are often intrested in how complex traits composed of many different variable evolve.  Because our GCMS data is multivariate (~50 compounds), we can calculate Blombergs K for each individaul compound as well as the entire datset as a whole. 

Prune MAP phylogeny to species with GCMS data
```{r Trim Tree for Phylogenetic Signal}
keepSpecies <- unique(as.character(scent$Species_Name_Full))
trimedTree <- drop.tip(tree,
                       tree$tip.label[-match(keepSpecies, tree$tip.label)])
plot(trimedTree) 
```


Extract scent emission data take the averge of biological replicates and wrangle the data into the proper formate for the downstream functons. 
```{r Scent Data Wrangle, results="hide"}
#1) 
# extract only scent data +  mass*time column
scentCompounds <- scent[,9:63] 

# Add species names back
scentCompounds$Species_Name_Full <- scent$Species_Name_Full 

#2)  Average Scent Data Accross Biological Replicates
avgScentCompounds <- aggregate( scentCompounds, 
                                by=list(scentCompounds$Species_Name_Full),
                                FUN = mean,
                                na.rm=TRUE)
#3)       
avgScentCompounds$Species_Name_Full <- NULL
row.names(avgScentCompounds) <- avgScentCompounds$Group.1
avgScentCompounds$Group.1 <- NULL
avgScentCompounds <- as.matrix(avgScentCompounds)
avgScentCompounds[,1:5] 
```

#### Bloombergs K VOC 
Data is formated, we can now calculate Blombergs K for each compound individually. 
```{r BlombergsK Individual}
yyy <- multiPhylosignal(avgScentCompounds, tree)
yyy[,1, drop=FALSE]
```
All compound have a K >1 indicating that closely related species are more similar than expected under brownian motion potentially due to other intresting process such as the evolution of pollination syndrome. 

While each compound/ biochemical pathway is likelie to be under its own evolutionary pressure, we may also expect that the entire floral emission profile may have as a whole. 

We can now calculate Blombergs K with the entire dataset as a whole. We test whether the entire floral boquet as a unit has less signal then expect under brownian motion. We ma sy expect that the entire floral 


To do this we perform a multivariate version of Blombergs K. Currently there are two implementation of this method. 


####PhyloCurve Implementation

```{r Multivarite BlombergsK}
model <- evo.model(trimedTree, avgScentCompounds)  
K.mult(model, nsim = 1000, plot = TRUE)
```
Figure Interpretation:
Black density plot is null distribution of K values from 1000 simulations of Brownian motion under a star phylogeny. Blue is a distribution of K values from 1000 simulations on the true phylogeny. Black dotted line is observe K value from multiveriate Bloomberg's K on observed data. This value falls well within the null distribution of simulation, indicating that there is no phylogenetic signal. 

####Geomorph Implimentation 
```{r Geomorph Multivarite BloombergsK }
zzz<-physignal(avgScentCompounds,trimedTree)
```

A quick note: 


## Test for Phylogenetic Signal
In addition to the VOC compounds GCMS we had some really awsome EAG data. We used this to show that Bees exhibited a stronger response to species with insect pollination syndromes rather then species with wind pollination syndromes. We wanted to test phylogenetic signal in as well as made an ancestral reconstruction. 

```{r Trim Tree for Ancestral State Reconstruction}
keepSpecies <- EAG$Species_Name_Full
trimedTree<-drop.tip(tree,
                     tree$tip.label[-match(keepSpecies, tree$tip.label)])
plot(trimedTree) 
```

```{r EAGResponse Data Wrangle}
continuousResponse <- as.matrix(data.frame(row.names = EAG$Species_Name_Full,
                                 EAG$EAG))[,1]

sigResponses <- as.matrix(data.frame(row.names = EAG$Species_Name_Full,
                                    EAG$EAG_Sig))[,1]
```

```{r EAG BloombergK}
EAGBloombergsK <- as.matrix(continuousResponse)
multiPhylosignal(EAGBloombergsK, tree)
```

#### Ancestral State Reconstruction
We reran an ancestral state reconstruciton on the smaller phylogeny
```{r EAGAncStateRecon }
g <- contMap(trimedTree, continuousResponse, plot = TRUE, type="phylogram")
````
